### Hi peeps, So worked on this project during my initial days of learning web-dev and even coding(You might tell it from the number of commits I have made). It's more of a webpage then a website and I have added some distinctive functionalities to it, for example:

**.** Animated Cloud Background 
**.** 5 day forecast using OpenWeather API
**.** Location based Weather using Leaflet Libray
